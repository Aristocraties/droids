# Notes regarding Florence
The goals for this project were simple.  I wanted to learn more about how to use AI API calls and Python in my personal life to double down on what I was doing professionally.  I wanted to see if I could make a static droid more dynamic by giving it a voice.  I expanded that a bit with the eyes as I wanted to learn how to incorporate LCDs rather than my traditional approaching using LEDs or Adafruit's Neopixels.

The readme files in the Arduino directory and the Raspberry Pi directory contains the instructions for each piece of hardware.  The documentation will continue once I have a fresh Raspberry Pi to try it all out again with.




:bulb: **Note:** For those interested in doing more with projects like this, I seriously suggest downloading [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (free) and paying the $10/month to use [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?ocid=AIDcmmc3fhtaow_SEM__k_Cj0KCQiA-62tBhDSARIsAO7twbYM6YrQkGoHRi_NgipA16C8Bjo5b-NuayWAoO5l4-kgdq5oTA0p9yUaAluYEALw_wcB_k_).  You integrate the two in the VS Code extensions.  It's the best set of coding tools I've used for projects like this.  For the Arduinos, you'd still use their IDE to upload code to the devices, but you can write all the code in VS Code and have the AI writing most of it for you.
